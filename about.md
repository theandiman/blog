Hi, I'm Andy, a software engineer passionate about building scalable, cloud-native applications. I specialize in:

- **Backend Development**: Java, Spring Boot, microservices architecture
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, containerization
- **Frontend Engineering**: React, TypeScript, modern web development
- **AI Integration**: Building practical AI-powered features using Gemini and other LLMs

This blog is where I share technical insights, lessons learned, and deep dives into interesting engineering problems I've encountered.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on a [Recipe Management Platform](https://github.com/theandiman/recipe-management) - a microservices-based application featuring AI-powered recipe generation, intelligent image creation, and comprehensive recipe storage.
