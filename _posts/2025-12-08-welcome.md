Welcome! This is the first post on my software engineering blog.

## What This Blog Is About

I created this space to share my experiences and insights from building software systems, with a focus on:

- **Cloud-native architecture** and microservices design patterns
- **Real-world DevOps practices** for CI/CD and infrastructure automation
- **AI/ML integration** in production applications
- **Modern web development** with React and TypeScript
- **Lessons learned** from building scalable systems

## What You Can Expect

I believe in practical, hands-on content. You'll find:

- Technical deep dives with working code examples
- Architecture decision records and trade-offs
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security best practices
- Real production war stories

## A Bit About Me

I'm a software engineer with expertise in Java/Spring Boot, TypeScript/React, and Google Cloud Platform. Recently, I've been exploring AI integration in web applications, building features powered by Google's Gemini and Imagen models.
